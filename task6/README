# Task 6: Advanced Security and Monitoring Configuration


First, I disabled direct root login over SSH by editing the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
setting `PermitRootLogin no`
then restarted the SSH service using `sudo systemctl restart ssh`. 


Next I secured the server with a firewall using `ufw`.
allowed only port 22 for SSH and restricted PostgreSQL port 5432 to localhost with:
(
sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
sudo ufw allow from 127.0.0.1 to any port 5432
sudo ufw enable
)

This prevents weak-password brute-force attacks. I verified by reconnecting using `psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U postgres -d postgres` and entering the new password.
